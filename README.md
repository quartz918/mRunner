# mRunner
mRunner App support page

mRunner requires models in tflite format to run. You can either train your own models with TensorFlow and convert it to a tflite file (see this jupyter notebook) or download ready-made models.

Instead of attaching metadata to your modelfiles you can use json init files to configure your model. A sample init file can be found [here](sampleInit.json).
